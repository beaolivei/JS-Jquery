# Client Side Javascript and JQuery

## Lecture Topics
1. What is the DOM and why we use it for
2. `Window`, `Navigator` and `Document`
3. Handling events
4. JQuery

### Important to remember: 
* All questions are welcomed. This is important for the group's learning process. 
* Create your own success baseline. And remember, each person has their own learning journey.
* From now on you will be introduced to a lot of new concepts and, probably, we won't have time to clarify everything during the lecture. Consider making notes of things that you would need to Google after the lecture. Not knowing something will be a common scenario in your developer career. During the bootcamp we want to empower you to be independent in your learning process.
